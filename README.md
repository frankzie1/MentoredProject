# MentoredProject

*Why are we doing this?
To implement the javascript and html learned in training and to research new useful methods.

*How I expected the challenge to go.
more challenging than previous tasks. 

*What went well?
Through a bit of trial and error I was able to complete it.

*What didn't go as planned?
Initially I had a few difficulties getting to get the filter by department function to work.

*Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
To ask for help, as other people may have a different perpective and suggest solutions I didn't think about.
